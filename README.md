FEATURE ENGINEERING

* Feature Selection: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/introduction-to-feature-selection-methods-with-an-example-or-how-to-select-the-right-variables/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
* Why Feature Selection:
 * It enables the machine learning algorithm to train faster.
 * It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.
 * It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.
 * It reduces overfitting.
* <b>Filter Methods</b>, the selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their <b>correlation with the dependent variable</b>. Example - Pearsonâ€™s Correlation, LDA, ANOVA, Chi-Square.
* <b>Wrapper Methods</b>, try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from your subset. These methods are usually computationally very expensive. Example - Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Recursive Feature elimination.
* <b>Embedded Methods</b>, implemented by algorithms that have their own built-in feature selection methods. Example - LASSO and RIDGE regression. <b>Lasso regression</b> performs L1 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. <b>Ridge regression</b> performs L2 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients. Other examples of embedded methods are Regularized trees, Memetic algorithm, Random multinomial logit.
* <b> Differences between Filter Methods and Wrapper Methods</b>
 * Filter methods measure the relevance of features by their correlation with dependent variable while wrapper methods measure the usefulness of a subset of feature by actually training a model on it.
 * Filter methods are much faster compared to wrapper methods as they do not involve training the models. On the other hand, wrapper methods are computationally very expensive as well.
 * Filter methods use statistical methods for evaluation of a subset of features while wrapper methods use cross validation.
 * Filter methods might fail to find the best subset of features in many occasions but wrapper methods can always provide the best subset of features.
 * Using the subset of features from the wrapper methods make the model more prone to overfitting as compared to using subset of features from the filter methods.
* <b>My strategy to use feature selection</b>
 * Use filter methods in data preprocessing step, before training. Choose the top features for model training.
 * Use wrapper methods during the model training step.

 * Connect to Oracle and Sql Server: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Data_Science_Resources/blob/master/DB_connection.R
 
 -- NOTE1: When using R to connect to Oracle, as Oracle SQL query requires you to use double quote for Alias, not single quites. Meanwhile, in R `dbGetQuery()` you have to use double quotes for the whole query. Then you can just use `\` in fornt of each double quote for Oracle query. For example, `dbGetQuery(con, "select col as \"Column1\" from my_table")`

 -- NOTE2: When using R to connect to SQL Server using RODBC, the limitation is each handler points to 1 database, therefore, you cannot join tables from multiple databases in 1 SQL Query in R. But! You can use R `merge` function to do Nature Join (special case of inner join), Left Join, Right Join and Full Outer Join. When I was running large amount of data, R even do joins faster than SQL Server!
 
 -- NOTE3: Because of the limitation of RODBC mentioned in NOTE2 above, sometimes before merging, the existing 2 pieces of data may occupy large memory and there will be out of memory error when you try to join data. When this happen, try this `options(java.parameters = "-Xmx3g")`, this means change the R memory into 3 GB

* <b>Challenges of Using R, and Compare with MapReduce </b>
 * Paper Source: http://shivaram.org/publications/presto-hotcloud12.pdf
 * R is primarily used as a single threaded, single machine installation. R is not scalable nor does it support incremental processing.
 * Scaling R to run on a cluster has its challenges. Unlike MapReduce, Spark and others, where only one record is addressed at a time, the ease of array-based programming is due to a global view of data. R programs maintain the structure of data by mapping data to arrays and manipulating them. For example, graphs are represented as adjacency matrices and outgoing edges of a vertex are obtained from the corresponding row.
 * Most real-world datasets are sparse.  Without careful task assignment performance can suffer from load imbalance: certain tasks may process partitions containing many non-zero elements and end up slowing down the whole system.
 * In incremental processing, if a programmer writes y = f(x), then y is recomputed automatically whenever x changes. Supporting incremental updates is also challenging as array partitions which were previously sparse may become dense and vice-versa.

* What to note when using PowerBI (free version)
 * A friend said PowerBI performs faster than Tableau10 when the data set is large, and there are many online libraries to download. So, it's still worthy to use PowerBI for data visualization. It's just as other MSFT products, never make your life easier although it has many functions looks cool. So, need to write down some notes when using it.
 * When using the free version, and want to create interactive vusualization that contains multiple charts, with multiple dataset, PowerBI desktop has more flexibility. But if we want to publish it to PowerBI dashboard, we could just publish the saved visualization file from Desktop
 * When the dataset for the visualization has chanhed, if the data structure has not been changed, click `Refresh` through PowerBI Desktop, it maybe able to update. Sometimes, when you only update several datasets instead of update them all, you may not be able to refresh, since the relationship between tables may put limitation on data refresh. When this problem happened, try to check the relationship between tables, and when updating the datasets, make sure these relationship won't be broken...
 * When you want to generate an url and let people see. There are 2 ways. One way is, on PowerBI Dashboard, Click Publish, then Click Share, the generated url can be seen by everyone. The other way is to Right Click the name of the dashboard you want to share, then grant the audience access by typying their emails. Click Access, the generated url can only be shared by these people. One thing to note is, when you are granting the access to the audience, those who with only emails have not set up PowerBI, those who with PowerBI Account Name have set up the PowerBI.
 * It is more convenient if your audience have installed PowerBI Mobile App, in this way, without sending them url but just grant them the access to your dashboard, they can see it through their mobile devides immediately.

* Data Analysis Tricks and Tips

-- ENSEMBLE

 * Ensemble modeling offers one of the most convincing way to build highly accurate predictive models. The availability of bagging and boosting algorithms further embellishes this method to produce awesome accuracy level.
 * Basic Ensemble Modeling: http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/introduction-ensemble-learning/
 * Ensemble Modeling: http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/questions-ensemble-modeling/
 * In Ensemble Modeling, we can combine multiple models of same ML algorithms, but combining multiple predictions generated by different algorithms would normally give you better predictions. It is due to the diversification or independent nature as compared to each other.
 * AdaBoost and Gradient Boost: http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/
 * Boosting may lead to overfittig if the sample data is too small.
 * All the Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) may lead to overfitting.

 * The above article is a real good one, besides some details I didn't learn from school, one thing I really like, it uses clustering for the data first, then added a new feature in the dataset which is the cluster numbers of the data, then do supervised learning. This is new but interesting to me!

 -- From the above article, I have made the summary that I think needs to keep in mind:

 * When drawing inferences from the data, check distributions and outliers first, and see whether you could use mean/mode or median.
 * Comparing different segment/cluster of data, compare Pre & Post situations.
 * <b>Extrapolation</b> - the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable.
 * <b>Confidence Interval</b> - a range of values so defined that there is a specified probability that the value of a parameter lies within it.
 * When doing extrapolation, always plot the confidence interval to the values to extrapolate, it's safer when it reaches to at least 90% confidence interval.
 * When the model has been extended to the population without past, check distribution of key features, if there is not too much change, it's safe, otherwise, changes of the model maybe needed.
 * Correlation is correlation, has nothing to do with causation.

LEARING FROM THE OTHERS' EXPERIENCES

* suggestions about analytics work (it looks useful, I just feel howcome these people in India are doing lots of data analytics work with machine learning knowledge, but in Vancouver or even in Canada, everything looks so out of dated, slow-paced.

 * Data Exploration
 * Feature Engineering (Feature Selection, Feature Transformaton, Feature Interaction and Feature Creation)
 * Validation to prevent from overfitting
 * Try Feature Selection with Cross Validation
 * Methods like R `findCorrelation()`, PCA could help feature selection when there is no label (dependent variable); methods like GBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, <b>R Boruta</b> (a very simple feature selection method) and PLS could tell feature importance when there is a label (dependent variable)
 * Model Ensembling!
 * <b>Sometimes can create derived dependent variable for prediction</b>
 * Review my evaluation metrics notes: https://github.com/hanhanwu/readings/blob/master/Evaluation_Metrics_Reading_Notes.pdf

 * The writer found <b>an ensemble with multiple models of different random states</b> and <b>all optimum parameters</b> sometime performs better than individual random state.
 * oob_score is similar to leave one out validation but faster.

 * feature engineering is very important
 * one-hot encoding is helpful too
 * understanding missing data can be helpful too
